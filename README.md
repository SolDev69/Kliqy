# Kliqy

Kliqy is a simple yet challenging 2D game where players control a ship to dodge incoming projectiles for as long as possible. Written in C++ using the GDI+ API for Windows, the game currently features a single game mode with plans for future expansion to include additional minigames.

## Gameplay

- *High Score Tracking*: Keep track of your best survival times.

## Development
